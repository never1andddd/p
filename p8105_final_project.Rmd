# Getting Data of Restaurant in business.json
```{r}
business <- stream_in(file("../data/business.json"))

# specificly we are only interested in the covariate price in the attributes
price = select(business$attributes,RestaurantsPriceRange2)

business_no_attri = select(business,-attributes,-hours)

business.dat = bind_cols(business_no_attri,price)

# for simplicity, we focus on restaurants in state of Arizona(AZ)
rest.dat = business.dat %>%
  mutate(categories = as.character(categories)) %>%
  filter(str_detect(categories, "Restaurants")) %>%
  filter(state == "AZ") 

# review <- stream_in(file("../data/review.json"))
```

# explore the categories of restaurants
## a rough preview of data
```{r}
cate.dat = rest.dat %>%
  mutate(categories = str_replace(categories,"c\\(","")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(category, categories) %>%
  select(-neighborhood)

# get an overview of categories
cate.dat %>%
  count(category, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(50)%>%
  mutate(category = fct_reorder(category, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = .6) + 
  coord_flip()
```
 We notice that:
 1. 'Restaurants', 'food', 'sports' gives no further information of what a restaurant serves. Therefore, we need to remove them.  
 2. Category 'american new' and 'american traditional' are devided into 3 categories namely 'american',
'new' and 'traditional'. This is redundant and we need to remove 'american' from this dataset.  
 3. Category 'chicken wings' is devided into 2 categories namely 'chicken' and 'wings'. This is redundant and we need to remove 'chicken' from this dataset. This is same for 'breakfast & brunch' and 'coffee & tea'. We will remove 'brunch' and 'tea' for simplicity.
 4. Category 'bar' and 'nightlife' are somewhat overlaid. Therefore, we remove 'night life'.  
 5. Category 'Event Planning & Services' is devided into 3 categories namely 'event', 'planning' and 'services'. These categories gives no further information of what a restaurant serves. Therefore, we need to remove them.  
 6. 

## data clean of category

stop_cates = data.frame(category) %>%

cate.dat = 
  anti_join(cate.dat, stop_cates)
  
categories = cate.dat %>%
  count(category, sort = TRUE) %>%
# omit categories with few restaurants, this is a trade-off because we might lose some restaurant, but we will get rid of some noise too
  top_n(20)

# get an overview of categories
categories %>%
  mutate(category = fct_reorder(category, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = .6) + 
  coord_flip()


# there are some variables that seem to make no sense like 'fast', 'traditional' and 'new'. explanation: 
final.dat = inner_join(categories,cate.dat) %>%
  unique() %>%
  distinct(name)

```{r}
